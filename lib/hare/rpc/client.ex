defmodule Hare.RPC.Client do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour module for implementing AMQP RPC client processes.

  The `Hare.RPC.Client` module provides a way to create processes that hold,
  monitor, and restart a channel in case of failure, exports a function perform
  RPC to an exchange and receive the response, and some callbacks to hook into
  the process lifecycle.

  An example `Hare.RPC.Client` process that performs a RPC request and returns
  the response, but returns `"already_requested"` when a request with the same
  payload has already been performed.

  ```
  defmodule MyRPCClient do
    use Hare.RPC.Client

      def start_link(conn, config, opts \\ []) do
      Hare.RPC.Client.start_link(__MODULE__, conn, config, :ok, opts)
    end

    def init(:ok) do
      {:ok, MapSet.new}
    end

    def before_request(payload, _routing_key, _opts, state) do
      case MapSet.member?(cache, payload) do
        {:ok, response} -> {:reply, "already_requested", state}
        :error          -> {:ok, MapSet.put(state, payload)}
      end
    end
  end
  ```

  ## Channel handling

  When the `Hare.RPC.Client` starts with `start_link/5` it runs the `init/1` callback
  and responds with `{:ok, pid}` on success, like a GenServer.

  After starting the process it attempts to open a channel on the given connection.
  It monitors the channel, and in case of failure it tries to reopen again and again
  on the same connection.

  ## Context setup

  The context setup process for a RPC client is to declare the exchange to perform
  requests to, declare a exclusive server-named queue to receive responses, and consume that server-named queue.

  Every time a channel is open the context is set up, meaning that the exchange and
  a new server-named queue are declared, and the queue is consumed through the
  new channel based on the given configuration.

  The configuration must be a `Keyword.t` that contains a single key: `:exchange`
  whose value is the configuration for the `Hare.Context.Action.DeclareExchange`.
  Check it for more detailed information.
